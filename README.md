# The Great RGB Color Game
This application was built as part of Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course.

This is The Great RGB Color Guessing Game where you are given a random color in the RGB color model and a number of different color tiles below. The aim of the game is to guess the correct color that matches the RGB digits above. There is a 'New Colors' button which will reset the game to a different color and if you are finding it too difficult, you can make things even easier by choosing the 'Easy' option which will reduce the number of tiles to 3. If you guess correctly, all of the tiles will change color and it will give you the option to play again.
