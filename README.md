# The Great RGB Color Game
This project was built as part of Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course.

HTML, CSS & JavaScript used. This is an RGB Color Guessing Game where you are given a random color in the rgb model and a number of tiles below where you must guess the correct color that matches the digits above. The 'New Colors' button will reset to a different color if you are finding it too difficult and to make things even easier - there is an easy mode option which will reduce the number of tiles to 3. If you guess correctly, all of the tiles will change color and it will give you the option to play again.

See screenshot in files for a preview or download to play!
